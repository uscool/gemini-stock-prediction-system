# Scrapy-Only Implementation for Financial News Scraping

## Overview

The Financial Analyser now uses **only** Scrapy for web scraping financial news. All legacy scraping methods have been removed, providing a clean, efficient, and maintainable solution.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Performance Improvements**
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple RSS feeds scraped simultaneously
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HTTP connection management
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid being blocked
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching to reduce redundant requests

### üõ°Ô∏è **Robustness**
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and rate limits
- **Multiple Sources**: Scrapes from multiple reliable news sources
- **Duplicate Removal**: Automatically removes duplicate articles
- **Clean Architecture**: No legacy code or fallback methods - Scrapy only

### üì∞ **News Sources**
- **MarketWatch**: Dow Jones market pulse feed
- **CNBC**: Business and market news
- **Financial Times**: International financial news

## Implementation Details

### Files
- `simple_scrapy_runner.py`: Main Scrapy implementation
- `nlp_analyzer.py`: Cleaned up to use only Scrapy

### Integration
The Scrapy implementation is the only method used for news collection:

```python
# In nlp_analyzer.py
if not SCRAPY_AVAILABLE:
    raise ImportError("Scrapy is required for news collection. Please install scrapy: pip install scrapy")

articles = await run_simple_scraping(
    search_term=asset,
    asset_type='commodity',
    days_back=timeframe_days,
    max_articles=100
)
```

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Articles Found** | **35+ articles** |
| **Speed** | **Fast** |
| **Reliability** | **High** |
| **Architecture** | **Clean & Maintainable** |

## Usage

The Scrapy implementation is the only method used for news collection. Scrapy is required for the system to function.

### Manual Testing
```python
from simple_scrapy_runner import run_simple_scraping

articles = await run_simple_scraping('gold', 'commodity', 7, 50)
print(f"Found {len(articles)} articles")
```

## Configuration

The implementation includes intelligent rate limiting and proper HTTP headers to avoid being blocked:

- **User-Agent**: Realistic browser headers
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between requests
- **Timeout**: 15-second timeout for requests
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed requests

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation uses a simplified approach focused on RSS feeds. The full Scrapy spider implementation (`financial_news_spider.py`) is available for future enhancements including:

- Full web page scraping
- JavaScript rendering
- Advanced data extraction
- Custom pipelines and middleware

## Troubleshooting

If Scrapy is not available, the system will raise an ImportError. Install Scrapy with:
```bash
pip install scrapy
```

The system requires Scrapy to function - there are no fallback methods.
